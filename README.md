# Stefano Tonello

Software engineer. Systems architecture, real-time graphics, procedural generation.

Working in tech and 3D since 2007. Background in IT, telecommunication engineering and tech management. I build things that need to be fast, correct, and deterministic.

## What I work on

- **Procedural simulation** - C++20, python, OpenGL, terrain generation, digital twins, data analysis and Artificial intelligence.
- **Real-time 3D** - Unreal Engine, CryEngine, custom rendering pipelines
- **AI-assisted development methodology** - [ControlCoding](https://github.com/Naimas/ControlCoding), structural guardrails for AI coding assistants
- **IoT and digital twins** - Hardware prototyping, real-time sensor data in 3D environments

## Selected work

**[ControlCoding](https://github.com/Naimas/ControlCoding)** - A methodology for keeping AI coding assistants under control. Mechanical boundary enforcement, domain invariants, graduated adoption. No CLI, no dependencies, works with any AI coding tool.

**Digital Twin for workplace safety** - Built a real-time 3D monitoring system in Unreal Engine: remote IoT sensors (Arduino), custom C++ data streaming, live environmental health visualization. End-to-end from hardware to rendering.

**Blockchain architecture (Cripstina Ltd)** - Designed the core architecture and tokenomics for a dual-token ecosystem. Strategic planning of the technical model, handed off to specialized blockchain teams for implementation.

## Technical stack

**Languages**: C++20, Python, Blueprint (UE), LSL, MATLAB

**3D**: Unreal Engine, 3ds Max, ZBrush, Substance Suite, Terragen, WorldMachine

**Hardware**: Arduino, IoT sensors, Industry 4.0 integration

## Where

- **Astera Srl** (2024 - present) - Founder. Technological solutions, systems architecture, complex integration.
- Previously: Cripstina Ltd (blockchain ops), GoSkilla (COO, art direction)
